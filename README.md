# Grid Traveler

In this challenge, you are given with two arguments to travel through in 2D grid from top-left corner to bottom-right edge of the grid.
gridTraveler(m+n)

## Constraints

- Diagonal traversing is not allowed
- Can either traverse in the right or down direction

### Time and Space complexity

#### Brute Force

O(2^m+n) time
O(m+n) space

#### Memoized

O(m\*n) time
O(m+n) space
