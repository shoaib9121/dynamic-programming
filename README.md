## Dynamic Programming Tips

### Alvin's Memoization Recipe

1. Make it work

- visualize the problem as a tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it

2. Make it efficient

- add a memo object(as an argument to func may be)
- add a base case to return memo values
- store return values into the memo
